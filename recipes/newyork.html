    <img src="images/newyork.jpg" alt="new york" width="310" height="300">


<p> We took our new No 12 Carbon Steel pan for a test run. We thought it would be appropriate to make a big ass  juicy New York Strip.  The sear was just incredible, 
    we are Steel guys, just what we expected. We basted this steak in organic butter and herbs. 
     Cooked it perfectly medium rare with a perfect sear....</p>
