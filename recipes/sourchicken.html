<p><Sweet and Sour Chicken is a classic Chinese takeout option most of us are too afraid to make at home. Something about woks and cooking with pineapple make it intimidating for most, but it is so much easier to make than you would think./p>
    <p>Of the classic Chinese Recipes that most people ask for on my blog the one I hear about the absolute most is sweet and sour chicken. I totally get it, it isn’t even just the recipe, but THAT SAUCE. When I was a teenager and I made this sauce for the first time I also actually started learning how to use chopsticks. So for a solid month (I kid you not, 
        my mom was not thrilled with this), I used chopsticks for every meal and had a tiny little bowl of Sweet and Sour Chicken Sauce to dip everything into it.</p>

           <H2>Steps</H2>

           <ol>
<li>Keep the breading super crispy and light. I have experimented with this recipe both in a tempura batter and a straight cornstarch coating.
     I prefer cornstarch for ease of use, but either way, you don’t want something doughy that will absorb your sauce like a sponge.</li>
     <li>Make sure you’re using GOOD pineapple chunks. I like either a super sweet fresh pineapple or the frozen chunks you get at Costco. T
         hey always have high quality frozen pineapple I’ve never been disappointed with.</li>
            <li>Don’t skip the onions. I know people may have aversions to them, but the onions and the bell peppers play an important role in balancing the flavors of the dish. 
                Without them, you would have a completely sweet entree with only a sour punch from the pineapple. 
                Adding a bit of bitter from the peppers and onions helps cut through the sweetness. 
                Trust me, you’ll be trying to snag extra onion pieces (assuming you don’t already really hate onions).</li>
